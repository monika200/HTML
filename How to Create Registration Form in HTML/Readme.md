**How to Create Registration Form in HTML**


    In this code, we use a <table> tag to format our form. Inside a table we use <tr> (table row) and <td> (table data). 
    Where <tr> is used to make a row in a table and <td> is used to make a column on that row of the table.
  

    We make our first row (lines 9 – 12) we make a column for name and its input field.

    In a second row (line 13 – 17) we make a column for password and its input field.

    After that, we make another row (line 18 – 23) we make a column for gender and make a radio button input field for gender.

    (Line 24 – 27) We make another row for the email address.

    (Line 28 – 41) Here we make a row for phone number input field and for a country code.

    (Line 42 – 44) At last, we make a submit button.

And here we complete making our Registration form in HTML
